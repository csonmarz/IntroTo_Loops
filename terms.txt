● Loops: A loop is a program construct that
repeatedly executes the loop's statements
(known as the loop body) while the loop's
expression is true; when false, execution
proceeds past the loop.

● Iteration: Each time through a loop's 
statements is called an iteration.

A program construct that repeatedly executes 
the loop's statements(known as the loop body) 
while the loop's expression is true; when false, execution

● Terminating Condition: Loops allows a 
program to repeat through a group of statements 
until a terminating condition is met.


● Infinite Loop: An infinite loop is a loop
that never stops iterating
